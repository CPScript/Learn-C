# We are going to start with the second part of our variable declaration, type variable_name, the variable_name. C does not allow you to throw anything down and call it a variable name, there are some restrictions.

# Names can be composed of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and underscores.
# The first character must be a letter (upper or lower case).
# No keywords are allowed as the full name (int is not allowed but int_count would work).
# Thatâ€™s it, nothing too crazy, just keep those rules in mind when you are creating your names for your variables

#Note...
# this is getting a bit easyer

#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
  
  int number;
