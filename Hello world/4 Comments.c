# When we write code it is important to document the code’s behavior. One way to do this is to add comments to our code.
# Starting a line with a double forward slash, //, will create a comment and the entire line will be ignored when we run the code.

// This is a single line comment
 
// This is 2 single line comments 
// together to explain a little more

# The comments like the ones above can be added above a line or block of code to describe the code’s behavior. 
# Shorter comments can be added to the end of a line of code as well.

printf("My dog is happy!"); // How my dog feels

# In both examples, once you use // the rest of the line is now a comment.

# If you want to create a comment with a beginning and end, 
# you can use /* to begin the comment and */ to end the comment. This is known as a block comment:

/* The following output will be
an outburst from my dog in a 
moment of pure joy after seeing 
another dog across the street. */
printf("Woof!");

# As you can see from the above example a block comment can wrap multiple lines without the use of anything but the beginning notation
/* and the ending notation */.
