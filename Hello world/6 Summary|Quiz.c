# Great work getting through these first exercises! Letâ€™s review what was covered:
* C has been around for a while but is still very popular
* Code syntax is a set of rules that are followed when writing code so the program is able to compile
* Errors occur when the syntax is incorrect
* Error messages make a best effort to describe the error and where it occurred
* Use printf() to output text to the console
* Comments are used to include text in code that the compiler will ignore
* Line comments start with // and block comments are surrounded by /* */
* The gcc application, or GNU Compiler Collection is a compiler used to compile C programs

d: A dicription of the error
   
   CORRECT ANSWER: B = A corrected line of code
   
3.Given a code file called quiz.c, which command would compile the code into an executable named quiz.
a: gcc quiz.c quiz
b: gcc quiz.c -o quiz
c: gcc quiz.c
d: gcc quiz -o quiz.c
    
    CORRECT ANSWER: B = gcc quiz.c -o quiz
    
4:Finish the code block below to output the following text:

5:In the code below, complete the comments with the proper syntax.
